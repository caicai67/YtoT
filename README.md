# Y to T

This is a set of node.js scripts for automating formatted video posts to tumblr, where the videos are taken directly from a YouTube playlist.

This set of scripts:

  1. Retrieves a video's data from a specified playlist (using the YouTube API)
  2. Saves the video data to the local project
  3. Moves the video to another, "used items" playlist (Using the YouTube API)
  4. Converts the file created in step 2 to another file formatted for tumblr
    a. Formats text for the post
    b. Adds only necessary data to the new file
  5. Creates a tumblr post using the file created in step 4 (using the tumblr API)

I have some tutorials in the works - a link will be posted here when they are ready.
